# The Terminal

The terminal is used to assemble multiblocks automatically.

Sneak right-clicking a multiblock controller with the terminal will place all blocks it can from your inventory, prioritizing using hatches/multiparts until it can place the minimum casing.

It is recommended to auto-build multiblocks with just their casing and other non multipart blocks in your inventory, then place your multiparts, as multiparts like hatches will likely not be placed where you want them to be.

The Terminal can use blocks from storages in your inventory such as a backpack from sophisticated backpacks.
