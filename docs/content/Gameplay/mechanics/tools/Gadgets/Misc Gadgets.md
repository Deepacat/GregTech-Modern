# Misc Gadgets
## Tape
Can be used (Shift right click) on a GregTech crate (Wooden - Tungstensteel) to package it, breaking it lets you pick up the crate with all its held storage being kept inside till you replace.
## Reinforced Duct Tape
Also allows taping crates, but moreso is used for putting inside of maintenance hatches to automatically fix a maintenance hatch diminishing state once, can be right clicked on the maintenance hatch, you can click the button inside the UI to apply one, or put them in the inventory slot of the hatch to hold up to a stack
## Matches/Lighters
Matches light a fire once and remove the item
Lighters hold butane or propene (Invar 100mb, Platinum 1000mb), filled by right clicking it while closed on a fluid storage or clicking the item onto an interface slot containing the fluid
Can be shift right clicked to open then light a fire with right click costing 1mb

## Cells
Used to carry one fluid of an amount, comes in varying sizes (iron-tungstensteel)
Can be clicked on a fluid storage or interface slot to pickup or place fluids depending on existing contents.
The base "Fluid Cell" is nearly identical to a bucket, holding only 1000mb exact of fluid but cannot place it in world, it can be converted to a "Universal Cell" Which can hold any mb amount up to 1000mb, with the rest of the higher material tier fluid cells all acting like a "Universal Cell" also being able to hold any mb amount of one fluid up to it's capacity.

## Spray Paint Cans
Can be right clicked on machines, multi-parts, pipes, cables, wires, and even AE2 cables to recolour them.
A right click applies the colour of the can to the selected block
Shift right clicking recolours all connected blocks to the original that match, e.g. shift right clicking a cable line will recolour the entire cable line, same for machines and everything else paintable
White paint only displays the original blocks colours for machines, works on everything else
Spray Paint Solvent works the same as a normal spray can but undoes all paint, shift right click behaviour applies
