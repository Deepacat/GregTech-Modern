## Machine Sides
- Right clicking on a machine side with a cover lets you edit it. (Can also now be done with sneak right clicking hand on it)
- When used on an output side of a machine, normal right click will enable auto output for the side.
- Sneak right clicking the output side changes the side to allow input from the output side.
