# Wrenches
# Breakables
Nearly every block in GregTech made from tiered materials can be broken with a wrench, machines, casings, frames, etc.

Fusion casings can ***only*** be broken by a wrench.

Most other mods that use sneak wrenching to break their blocks will also let the GregTech wrenches use this interaction.

# Machine interactions
- Right clicking a machine side with the wrench changes the output side, on steam machines it changes the side of the steam vent.
- Sneak right clicking something that cannot be directed will change the mode of the wrench, from item > fluid > both, the mode is what defines what output side type you're changing when right clicking the side of a machine.
- Sneak right clicking a machine side other than the face changes the side of the machines face, this also applies to hatches, multiblock controllers, and anything else that can change face direction.
- Sneak right clicking the face of a rotate-able block, such as most multiblock controllers, will rotate the controller allowing it to form the multiblock in a different direction, even vertically.

# Pipes
Right clicking on a fluid or item pipes side will open the connection for that side, this is needed as pipes do not attach unless placed on a storage or another pipe.

Sneak right clicking a pipe side will add an arrow to the pipe, this arrow makes it impossible for fluids or items to travel back into it, it is heavily recommended to do this for all of your fluid pipes to prevent "sloshing" of fluids, where a fluid keeps going back and forth through the pipe and ruining throughput, as well as potentially costing performance loss. 

Currently the pipe arrows have a graphical issue where the large pipes do not fully show the arrow in some configurations, and the huge pipe only shows the arrow on the sides that are opened.
